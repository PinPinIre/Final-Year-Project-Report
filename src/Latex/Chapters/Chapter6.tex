\chapter{Conclusion}
In this chapter I will discuss what this project achieved and how it addressed the research question as stated in chapter 1.
Any future work which could be done based on the work of this project will also be discussed.

\section{Summary}
The overall aim of this research project was to evaluated the performance of machine learning algorithms and pick the best one for generating document recommendations.

In chapter 1 the main objectives and challenges were outlined and briefly discussed.
During the course of this project I was able to research the state-of-the-art algorithms to test, sourced a large corpus of educational documents, processed this corpus into the appropriate formats, build a model for each of the algorithms being evaluated, and evaluated the performance criteria as outlined in chapter 3.

The temporal performance and quality of recommendations for LDA, k-NN and Word2Vec were evaluated and ranked on their overall performance.
It would seem that LDA was the best of the three algorithms for the corpus used.
LDA performed well for temporal performance and it consistently generated the best recommendations.
From this I could conclude that of the 3 algorithms investigated, LDA is the better of the three if the intention is to generate document similarity recommendations.
