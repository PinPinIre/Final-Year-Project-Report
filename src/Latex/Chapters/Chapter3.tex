\chapter{Design}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter provides a description of the design decisions for the research project being conducted.
This builds upon the state of the art technology which was previously discussed in chapter 2.
In this chapter the requirements for the project are also discussed in relation to the objectives and challenges which were listed in chapter 1.
The overall system architecture will be presented in the form of UML diagrams.

\section{Requirements}
Based on the objectives and challenges as listed in chapter 1, the requirements can be split into corpus requirements and implementation requirements.
The corpus requirements deal with the selection of the corpus and sampling of the when test are run across different sizes of the corpus.
The implementation requirement deal with the three algorithms chosen and the different libraries used to implement them in the project.

\subsection{Corpus Selection}
In the context of generating recommendations for a student an academic or educational corpus should be used.
The availability of a large and respected educational corpus poises a problem however.
It was decided that academic papers from arXiv would act as a proxy for educational resources.
This in itself could create a problem due to how academic papers are usually written.
The language of an academic paper is usually quite different to the language used in a textbook or a lecture.
The language used is generally an advanced discussion of a particular subject, which itself could have it's own vocabulary.
This is particularly relevant for the arXiv corpus which has a large number of papers related to mathematics and physics.

While arXiv may not be the perfect educational corpus it is an adequate proxy.
The arXiv corpus could also be comparable to the corpus used by Blei in his paper on LDA.
In the Blei experiment, LDA was applied to approximately 22,000 articles from the journal Nature.
In that experiment Blei created an LDA model with 50 topics and used it to identify topics with documents and to find documents of a similar topic.

\subsection{Document Preprocessing}
The documents that are retrieved from the arXiv Amazon S3 bucket are saved as PDF documents.
As we are only interested in the textual content of the papers we must convert the PDF version of the papers to a plain text representation.
The size of the arXiv corpus was also considered during this step.
As each paper is independent of other papers, the conversion to plain text could be carried out in parallel.
This greatly speeded up the preprocessing stage as a four core machine could convert four papers at once.

Each of the arXiv papers follows the naming convention as follows: \textit{<topic><paperid>}.
This metadata can be used to sort the papers in directories based on their arXiv topic and to calculate the distribution of papers from specific areas.
More importantly this metadata allows us to compare the similar document recommendations generated against the arXiv topics.
If we consider the arXiv groupings to be a baseline we could assume that recommendations generated should return a large number of documents that are also in the same arXiv topic.

\subsection{Corpus Sampling}
The corpus selected contains approximately 50,000 academic papers from arXiv.
The corpus contains a mixture of papers from Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science and Nonlinear Sciences.
The papers are further split into smaller specific sections which have been selected by a moderator from arXiv.
There is however a disproportionate number of papers related to physics compared to the other sections.
As the algorithms are to be applied to a corpus of varying size the distribution of papers from each of the arXiv sections should be maintained.
This should be done in order to prevent papers from a particular topic or area from dominating the models generated.

To overcome this problem the system could sample papers from each of the arXiv defined topics.
