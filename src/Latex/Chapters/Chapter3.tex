\chapter{Design}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter provides a description of the design decisions for the research project being conducted.
This builds upon the state of the art technology which was previously discussed in chapter 2.
In this chapter the requirements for the project are also discussed in relation to the objectives and challenges which were listed in chapter 1.
The overall system architecture will be presented in the form of UML diagrams.

\section{Requirements}
Based on the objectives and challenges as listed in chapter 1, the requirements can be split into corpus requirements and implementation requirements.
The corpus requirements deal with the selection of the corpus and sampling of the when test are run across different sizes of the corpus.
The implementation requirement deal with the three algorithms chosen and the different libraries used to implement them in the project.
