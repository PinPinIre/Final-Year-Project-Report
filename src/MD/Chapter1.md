## Introduction and Motivation
In recent years there has been an explosion in online learning resources.
From the open access of arXiv to the rapid rise of the MOOC (Massive Open Online Course).
These systems however only provide the learner with access to learning resources, they do not guarantee quality nor do they always facilitate a logical pathway to knowledge.
In the pre-digital age some of this information would have been catalogued by a human and archived in a library.
In the current digital age however the flood of information is too huge to be finely catalogued by human operators.
This presents learners with the challenge of finding relevant information to suit their needs.

Often learners may be looking for information related to something they have already read but are unable to bridge the gap between what they have already read and what they should read next.
The aim of this project is to evaluate the use of popular machine learning algorithms to generate recommendations for a student.

More precisely this project will evaluate the performance of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, K-Nearest Neighbours and Word2Vec.
The performance will be evaluated on temporal performance, quality of results and results compared to a gold standard.
Furthermore this project will detail the background of each of the algorithms.
